# MCP Tools

Packet Tracer MCP exposes **79 tools**, grouped below by purpose. Tools that touch
a running Packet Tracer require the [live bridge](live-deploy.md) to be connected.

!!! tip "Discover first"
    Call `pt_list_devices` (and `pt_list_modules` before installing expansion cards)
    so the LLM uses real model names, ports and cables from the catalog. Most
    NAT/ACL/module tools accept `dry_run=True` to preview the generated CLI/JS
    without touching PT.

## Catalog & discovery

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `pt_list_devices` | List all 74 device models with their exact ports + ~100 aliases. |
| `pt_get_device_details` | Ports/details for one model (accepts a model name or alias). |
| `pt_list_templates` | List the 9 topology templates and their defaults. |
| `pt_list_modules` | List expansion modules; optional `router_model` / `category` filter. |
| `pt_list_projects` | List saved projects under the exports directory. |

## Planning

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `pt_plan_topology` | Generate a full `TopologyPlan` (devices, links, IPs, routing, DHCP). |
| `pt_estimate_plan` | Fast dry-run: device/link/subnet counts and complexity, no full plan. |
| `pt_validate_plan` | Validate a plan; returns typed errors and warnings. |
| `pt_fix_plan` | Auto-fix a plan (cables, port reassignment, model upgrades). |
| `pt_explain_plan` | Explain the plan's design choices in natural language. |

## Generation & export

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `pt_generate_script` | Emit the PTBuilder JavaScript (`lwAddDevice`/`lwAddLink`/…). |
| `pt_generate_configs` | Emit IOS CLI configs for every router and switch + host settings. |
| `pt_export` | Write script, per-device configs and plan JSON to `projects/<name>/`. |
| `pt_load_project` | Load a previously saved project's plan. |
| `pt_full_build` | One-shot pipeline: plan → validate → generate → explain → (deploy). |
| `pt_deploy` | Copy the PTBuilder script to the clipboard + export files. |

## Live bridge

The bridge has **two channels** and picks one per command automatically: **HTTP**
while the MCP Control Center window is open, and a **file-bridge** (the Script
Engine reads a per-user mailbox) when the window is closed but PT is
still open. Every tool below works over either. See [Live deploy](live-deploy.md).

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `pt_bridge_status` | Which channel is connected (HTTP, file-bridge, or both). |
| `pt_live_deploy` | Stream a plan into a running PT (devices, links, configs). |
| `pt_query_topology` | List devices currently in PT with ports and per-port IPs. |
| `pt_export_topology` | Full snapshot: positions, per-interface IPs, links, cable info. |
| `pt_save_project` | Save the running topology as a real `.pkt` file. |
| `pt_open_project` | Open a `.pkt` in PT (replaces the current topology). |
| `pt_send_raw` | Run arbitrary JS in PT's Script Engine (`wait_result` injects `reportResult`). |

## Live editing

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `pt_add_device` | Add one device (validates name, model, no duplicates). |
| `pt_add_link` | Link two devices; validates ports are free; infers cable if omitted. |
| `pt_delete_link` | Remove the link on a given interface. |
| `pt_delete_device` | Delete a device (via `getLogicalWorkspace().removeDevice()`). |
| `pt_rename_device` | Rename a device. |
| `pt_move_device` | Move a device to new canvas coordinates. |
| `pt_set_port` | Low-level port attributes (bandwidth, duplex, description, MAC, power). |
| `pt_add_module` | Install one expansion module (auto power-cycle). Reports `installed`/`failed` directly; it used to always time out. |
| `pt_remove_module` | Remove the module in a slot (auto power-cycle) and report which ports disappeared. |
| `pt_install_modules_batch` | Install several modules in one power-cycle (preferred for many). |

## Device panel: CLI, Desktop and Services

Everything a student does inside a device's window, done through PT's own API: no
mouse, no keyboard, nothing taken over on screen. What you type with `pt_cli` shows
up in the device's real CLI tab, so the user can watch or take over at any time.

| Tool | Window it drives | What it does |
|------|------------------|--------------|
| `pt_cli` | CLI tab (router/switch) | Type IOS commands one at a time, waiting for the prompt. Each comes back `ok`, `ERROR`, `unknown command` (IOS took it as a hostname; the DNS lookup is aborted), `waiting for an answer` or `timeout`. Presses Enter on `[confirm]` and `Destination filename [..]?`; `[yes/no]` and `Password:` are answered by the next command. A freshly deployed router is primed automatically. |
| `pt_host_command` | Desktop › Command Prompt | `ping`, `ipconfig`, `tracert`, `arp -a`, `nslookup`, `telnet`/`ssh` (answers via `inputs`). |
| `pt_terminal` | PC Desktop › Terminal | Find the router at the other end of the PC's console cable and type on its console, as from the PC's Terminal app. |
| `pt_host_ip_config` | Desktop › IP Configuration | Static IP or DHCP (waits for the lease), mask (`24` or dotted), gateway, DNS, IPv6 autoconfig. |
| `pt_host_firewall` | Desktop › Firewall | Inbound IPv4/IPv6 firewall on or off. |
| `pt_web_browser` | Desktop › Web Browser | Open a URL and return the page as text; in UI mode the window's own browser navigates. |
| `pt_email_client` | Desktop › Email | Configure the account, send, or ask the POP3 server for mail. |
| `pt_server_dhcp` | Services › DHCP | Create, edit or delete pools, exclude ranges, switch the service on/off. |
| `pt_server_dns` | Services › DNS | Add or remove A and CNAME records, then confirm each one is stored. |
| `pt_server_http` | Services › HTTP | Replace or create pages, switch HTTP/HTTPS. |
| `pt_server_service` | Services › TFTP/FTP/SYSLOG/EMAIL | Toggle the service; FTP users with permissions; email accounts. |
| `pt_read_device_panel` | all tabs, read-only | Model, power, per-port IP/MAC/state/IPv6/firewall/bandwidth, which server services are on. |

### Headless or UI mode

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `pt_ui_mode` | `headless` (default: nothing opens) or `ui` (every tool above also opens the device window on the matching tab/app). Persists across restarts; `PT_MCP_UI_MODE` overrides it. |
| `pt_ui_open` | Open a device window on a tab (`CLI`, `Desktop`, `Services`, `Config`…), Desktop app (`command_prompt`, `web_browser`, `email`…) or section (`DHCP`, `FastEthernet0`…). |
| `pt_ui_capture` | Save a PNG of a device window (or the main window), even when it is covered. Returns the path. |
| `pt_ui_close` | Close one device window, or all of them. |

Each panel tool also takes `show=True/False` for a single call (it wins over the
mode) and `capture=True` to save a PNG once it is done. `output_dir` is a sanitized
single folder name under the resolved output root, as with `pt_screenshot`.
Use `PT_MCP_OUTPUT_DIR` to select an absolute root; see the
[per-OS path table](live-deploy.md#per-os-paths). Claude Code exposes the
prompts `/mcp__packet-tracer__ui_on`, `ui_off` and `ui_status`.

| OS | UI mode |
|---|---|
| Windows | UI Automation and posted canvas clicks; the real cursor does not move. Captures use `PrintWindow`. |
| macOS | Accessibility navigates panels; PT comes to the front, and canvas clicks briefly move and restore the cursor. Capture requires Screen Recording permission. |
| Linux | UI mode not yet available; every panel tool works headless. |

UI dependencies install automatically. On macOS, `pt_ui_mode("ui")` requests the
two grants and names the responsible app; follow the
[privacy setup](installation.md#macos-privacy-grants-for-ui-mode). `pt-mcp doctor
--ui` diagnoses the process from which it is run without prompting.

!!! warning "What PT 9.0.1 does not let an extension do"
    PC Wireless profiles (the API throws `invalid vector subscript` on every
    call), the Text Editor (no file API on PCs), the EMAIL service's *Domain
    Name* and individual host-firewall rules. Open the window with `pt_ui_open`
    and set those by hand.

## NAT & ACL

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `pt_apply_nat` | Apply NAT/PAT (`static` / `dynamic` / `pat`) on a live router. |
| `pt_remove_nat` | Remove a NAT/PAT configuration. |
| `pt_apply_acl` | Build, validate and apply a standard/extended/named ACL via CLI. |
| `pt_apply_acl_object` | Same, via PT's ACL object API (faster, fewer modal popups). |
| `pt_remove_acl` | Remove an ACL (and unbind it) via CLI. |
| `pt_remove_acl_object` | Remove an ACL via the object API. |

## Switching, security & tuning

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `pt_apply_vlan` | VLANs, access ports, trunks + router `.1q` subinterfaces (inter-VLAN routing). |
| `pt_apply_stp` | Spanning-tree mode, root primary, per-VLAN priority, portfast, BPDU guard. |
| `pt_apply_port_security` | Port-security: max MACs, sticky/static MACs, violation action. |
| `pt_apply_hardening` | hostname, banner, enable secret, local users, SSH (RSA keys + vty), password-encryption. |
| `pt_apply_interface_tuning` | Serial clock-rate (DCE), bandwidth, per-interface OSPF/EIGRP knobs. |

All accept `dry_run=True` to preview the generated CLI without touching PT.

## Server services

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `pt_configure_dhcp_server` | Create, edit or remove a DHCP pool on a **Server-PT** (the GUI's Services > DHCP) and switch the service on or off — network, mask, gateway, DNS, start IP, max users — then read every pool back. Without `network` it only reads. |

!!! note "Router DHCP and server DHCP are two different things"
    A router's pool is IOS CLI (`ip dhcp pool`), which is what `dhcp=True` in the
    planner emits. A Server-PT has no CLI: its pools live behind
    `getProcess("DhcpServerMain").getDhcpServerProcessByPortName("FastEthernet0")`,
    one level below where it looks — `DhcpServerMain` itself has no pool methods.

    Give the server a static IP inside the pool's subnet first. Packet Tracer never
    leases the server's own address, but it **will** lease the gateway's if the
    range covers it, so start the range after the router. And if you name your own
    pool, the factory `serverPool` adapts itself to the server's subnet and starts
    leasing from `.1` — the tool deletes it while it is still unconfigured
    (`drop_factory_pool=True`).

    Changing a pool does not move hosts that already hold a lease, even one now
    outside the range: run `ipconfig /release` and `ipconfig /renew` on them.

## Verification

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `pt_diff` | Compare a plan vs the live topology (missing/extra devices, IP mismatches). |
| `pt_health_check` | Sweep the live topology: down links, cabled-without-IP, duplicate IPs. |
| `pt_verify_connectivity` | Run a **real ping** from a device's console and parse the result (reachable or not). |

## Live-state inspection

These read the **device**, not the plan — useful to confirm a change landed, or to
understand a topology you didn't build. Verified against PT 9.0.0.0810.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `pt_audit_security` | Security posture of every IOS device, graded high/medium/low: missing `enable secret`, reversibly-stored credentials (type 7), `service password-encryption` off, no local users, no MOTD banner, config-register left at `0x2142`. |
| `pt_inspect_ports` | Per-port line/protocol status, MAC, IP, duplex, bandwidth, MTU, delay, CDP, DHCP-client, NAT mode and applied ACLs. Flags cabled-but-down and line-up-protocol-down. |
| `pt_read_vlans` | The switch's real VLAN database, separating your VLANs from PT's factory ones (1, 1002-1005). |
| `pt_device_power` | Power a device off/on with read-back — simulate an outage, or force a reboot so a router rereads its startup-config. |

## Canvas: capture & annotations

Turn a topology into something you can hand to a class. The agent stops
describing the network and starts showing it.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `pt_screenshot` | Capture the logical canvas to an image file and return its path. |
| `pt_add_note` | Write a text note on the canvas — label a subnet, name a trunk. |
| `pt_clear_annotations` | Remove notes and drawings. Never touches devices or links. |

!!! tip "Self-documenting topologies"
    Combine them: build with `pt_full_build`, label each subnet and link with
    `pt_add_note`, then `pt_screenshot`. The result is a diagram ready for a
    slide, produced from one prompt.

!!! warning "There is no drawing tool"
    Packet Tracer can draw lines and circles on the canvas, but not usefully
    from an extension: the size argument turned out to control stacking order
    rather than radius or thickness — three circles asking for 60, 60 and 300
    all came out the same tiny size — and the colour arguments do not produce
    the colour requested. Rather than ship parameters that don't do what they
    say, annotation is limited to text notes.

!!! note "The screenshot returns a path, not the image"
    A capture runs to tens of thousands of bytes. Returning it inline would fill
    the model's context with data nobody can look at, so the file is written to
    disk and only its path comes back. PNG is the default because it compresses a
    line diagram far better than JPG — measured on the same canvas, 33 KB versus
    105 KB.

## Backup & workspace

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `pt_backup_config` | The device's real startup-config — the one it rereads on reboot — plus serial, config-register, boot images and uptime. `include_xml=True` adds the full device dump. |
| `pt_project_metadata` | The open project's saved filename, the PT version that wrote it, its description and the device/link count. Pass `description` to set it. |
| `pt_workspace_options` | Read or toggle workspace behaviour: auto-cabling, access to the **real** network, and the canvas labels that decide whether a screenshot is readable. |

!!! tip "Turn auto-cabling off before a scripted build"
    With auto-cabling on, Packet Tracer picks the cable and the port for you. If
    you want a link on an exact interface, `pt_workspace_options(auto_cabling=0)`
    first.

## Telemetry & QoS

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `pt_apply_netflow` | Create, reconfigure or remove a NetFlow exporter on a router — collector address, UDP port, version, source interface, monitors — and read the result back. |
| `pt_read_qos` | Read the device's real class-maps and policy-maps, including each one's CLI form and which features a policy uses (bandwidth, priority, shaping, fair-queue). |

!!! note "NetFlow is configured natively; QoS can only be read"
    These two look symmetric but are not. `pt_apply_netflow` configures the
    exporter directly and verifies the result — no CLI involved. QoS, by
    contrast, can be **read** but not created programmatically, so class-maps and
    policy-maps are authored through IOS CLI (`pt_send_raw` →
    `configureIosDevice`) and `pt_read_qos` is how you confirm it landed.

## Simulation

Packet Tracer's Simulation mode holds packets in an event list instead of moving
them in real time, which is what makes a step-by-step trace possible.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `pt_simulation_mode` | Switch between Realtime and Simulation. |
| `pt_simulation_step` | Advance, rewind or reset the simulation (`forward` / `back` / `reset`). |
| `pt_read_packet_trace` | Read the event list: per frame the device, ingress/egress port, source, destination, traffic type and outcome — **plus PT's own per-OSI-layer explanation** of what the device decided and why. |

!!! tip "`pt_read_packet_trace` answers *why*, not just *what*"
    The decision log is the same text Packet Tracer shows in its **PDU Details**
    pane. A failing ping stops being "no reply" and becomes a cause:

    ```
    L3 :: The destination IP address is in the same subnet. The device sets the next-hop to destination.
    L2 :: The next-hop IP address is not in the ARP table. The ARP process tries to
          send an ARP request for that IP address and buffers this packet.
    ```

!!! warning "There is no `pt_send_pdu`"
    Packet Tracer does not let an extension originate a packet the way the GUI's
    *Add Simple PDU* button does. Generate traffic the way a user would —
    `pt_verify_connectivity` runs a real ping — and then read the trace.

!!! warning "`pt_audit_security` never returns credentials"
    Passwords and hashes do not leave the device. The reader classifies each
    credential by its prefix and transmits only the algorithm label (`md5`,
    `type7`, `scrypt`, …) — enough to audit, without putting a hash into the LLM's
    context or the MCP client's logs.

!!! tip "Build flags"
    `pt_plan_topology` / `pt_full_build` accept `vlans` (router-on-a-stick VLAN count),
    `dual_stack` (IPv6: routers via CLI + hosts via SLAAC), `ipv6_base`, and
    `wireless_laptops` (Laptop-PT → wireless NIC + auto-associated Access Point).

!!! note "Cable types for `pt_add_link`"
    Valid: `straight`, `cross`, `serial`, `fiber`, `console`, `roll`, `phone`,
    `coaxial`, `auto`, `usb`. Aliases: `crossover`→`cross`, `rollover`→`roll`.
    Omit `cable_type` to infer it from the device categories.
