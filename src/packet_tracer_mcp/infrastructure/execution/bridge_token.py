"""Shared secret between the MCP server and the client inside Packet Tracer.

The HTTP bridge listens on loopback, but that does NOT protect it: a
`POST /queue` with `Content-Type: text/plain` is a "simple" CORS request, so
any web page open in the browser could queue JavaScript that PT runs with
`new Function()`. Binding to 127.0.0.1 does not stop the request from being
sent — it only prevents reading the response, and the injection never needed to read anything.

What does close it is a secret that the attacker's web page cannot guess or
derive. That is why the token is random and persisted, not derived from the time or
from any public data: this repo is public and the attacker runs on the same
machine, so any algorithm we can derive, they can derive too.
